### INTRODUCTION 

Hello and Welcome!  

This GitHub portfolio showcases practical analytics and data engineering work, including SQL queries and data models, Python-based data cleaning and transformation scripts, Power BI dashboards, and end-to-end reporting projects. Each repository projects I have previously worked on and reflect how I approach analytics in production environments. The projects highlight my ability to translate business requirements into technical solutions, apply analytical rigor, and communicate results through clean, well-documented code and visualizations.

### ABOUT ME

I am a data specialist with a strong engineering mindset, backed by over 20 years of experience in technical IT environments. My analytics background was shaped through hands-on work in license auditing, operational reporting, and data analysis at my past roles, where I applied structured problem-solving to real-world datasets. I have experience across the end-to-end analytics workflow, including data extraction and transformation using SQL and Python, data quality validation, KPI definition, and the development of scalable reporting and dashboard solutions. My technical toolkit includes SQL, Power BI, Python, and Advanced Excel, with a focus on building reliable, maintainable data models and delivering insights that directly support business and operational decision-making.
